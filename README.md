# Overview
In this project, we use a variety of ML techniques to develop an algorithm to estimate the number of shares an article will receive. The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) is extracted from close to 40,000 articles posted on Mashable.com, and provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

This project was created for CSE517A SP2018 at Washington University in St. Louis. Each milestone is contained in its respective folder.
