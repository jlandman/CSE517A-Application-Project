This folder contains the resources used for the first milestone of the 517a application project. 

The file target_comparison.py can be executed using Python 3. It generates histograms that show the rationale behind estimating the logarithm of the number of shares, rather than the number itself.

The file ridge_cross_validation.py can also be executed using Python 3. It performs 10-fold cross validation on the data using a ridge regression model. The cross-validation error is minimized over possible values of lambda, and both the training and cross-validation error are plotted as a function of lambda.

The file ?.py trains a ridge regression model from the lambda
